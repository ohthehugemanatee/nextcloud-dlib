# Nextcloud-dlib

This is a build of LinuxServer's [Nextcloud](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-nextcloud) with dlib included to support the [face recognition](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/facerecognition) app.

It s quick and pretty dirty, but it works.

Usage is documented at https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-nextcloud .
